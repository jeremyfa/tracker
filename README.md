# Tracker

A set of tools to manage events, observable and serializable properties, autorunable functions and data models in general.

This framework has been tested on real use cases when it was embedded in [ceramic engine](https://github.com/ceramic-engine/ceramic).

This is an effort to have an independant haxe library that can also be used outside ceramic, because it can!
